# 🦖 Dino-MST: Kruskal &amp; Prim Algorithms in JS MVC 🦕

This repository features the Kruskal and Prim algorithms for Minimum Spanning Trees (MST), implemented using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in JavaScript.
🚀 Explore how these algorithms work with a sleek visual interface that lets you build and traverse your very own graph!


Kruskal's Algorithm 🕸️: A greedy approach to connect all graph nodes with the least-cost edges while avoiding cycles, leveraging a Union-Find structure to keep track of connected components.

Prim's Algorithm 🏗️: Another greedy strategy, this time growing the MST by expanding from a single node, always selecting the smallest-weight edge connecting to an unvisited node, with priority queue support for performance.

## **🔄 Note:**

When you refresh the page, a new graph is generated automatically with different edge values. If you need to visualize multiple graphs, just refresh the page and a new graph will be displayed. 🔁
